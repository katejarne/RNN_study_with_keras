# RNN_study_with_keras
Paper code and trained networks.
Implemented with Python 2.7 Keras 2.0.6 and TensorFlow 1.0.1
Runs with GPU.

It generates, print and analyses RNN that perform the lisk of task described in Arxiv paper.

1) To print and study a  network use load_and_print_xxx.py

2) To generate a set of networks use loop_to_call.py and import the corresponding .py to generate data_set_xx.py and binary_xx.py the network.

3) If you want to see the data set generation type run generate_data_set_xx.py.
